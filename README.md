Description: An Alexa Skill that uses Chat GPT to answer your questions.

Currently, due to the official ChatGPT API not yet released, this Alexa Skill uses the 'text-davinci' model from OpenAI in order to complete and respond to the user's question.

Todo:
- Look into ways to allow users to use their own OpenAI account
- Implement rate limiting based on token usage
